Based upon, but not identical to, the first chapter of Martin Fowler's classic book: Refactoring.

* [O'Reilly Safari](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/ch01.xhtml)

The `master` branch contains the original version of the code. The final version, after refactoring, can be found in the `final` branch.

Run tests
---------

Evolving tests along the refactoring is very important. In order to run the tests in the console, you can use Maven:

```
# ./mvnw test
```
